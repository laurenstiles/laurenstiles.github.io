I am interested in land/marine ecosystem management practices and how they affect local ecology and climate change resilience.

**Aquatic Macroinvertebrates**

I am currently researching aquatic macroinvertebrate responses to ecological restoration at the Devereux Slough right next to UCSB! I want to know whether there are any changes between assemblages before restoration compared to during the current maintenance phase. I've spent two years with this project and feel passionate about getting new students involved to continue the program.

**Agroecology**

I am learning a lot about agroecology in my coursework this year and I have been loving it! I am inspired by the countless methods for maintaining soil health, plant health, human health, and sustaining harvests that take ecological interactions into account. I am excited about the potential to increase this kind of agriculture and to combine it with restoration and conservation methods to increase resiliency for years to come.

**Lake Systems**

I am also working with UCSB PhD student Michelle Lee researching the effects of trout introduction in Sierra Nevada alpine lakes on both surrounding vegetation and visiting pollinators. We are currently in the data wrangling phase and I am super excited to see the results and what they might mean for managament of these lakes.

**Herbivory on Coral Reefs**

Last year, I worked with UCSB PhD student Nury Molina on her project investigating how different species of herbivorous fish utilize algae resources in tropical coral reef ecosystems. My role was to analyze video footage of herbiverous fish and identify their grazing habits.
